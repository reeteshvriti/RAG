Problem Statement: Ask Your AI Doctor

In today's digital era, patients frequently turn to the internet for medical information, often encountering misleading,
inaccurate, or unverified health advice. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety, incorrect self-diagnosis, and delays in 
seeking professional medical help.

To address this, we propose developing "Ask Your AI Doctor", an AI-powered medical chatbot that leverages
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide accurate, contextually relevant,
and trustworthy responses to health-related queries. By integrating a vector database for medical knowledge retrieval 
and a state-of-the-art language model, the chatbot will ensure that responses are factually grounded in verified medical
sources such as research papers, clinical guidelines, and healthcare databases.

Key Objectives:
1️⃣ Accurate & Trustworthy Responses – The chatbot will fetch and generate answers backed by reliable medical literature.
2️⃣ Context-Aware Retrieval – Using vector search to retrieve the most relevant clinical information before generating a response.
3️⃣ User-Friendly Interface – Providing clear, non-technical explanations for patients while preserving medical accuracy.
4️⃣ Efficient Query Processing – Optimizing retrieval and response generation for real-time interactions.
5️⃣ Scalability & Deployment – Deploying the chatbot for public use, with potential integration into telemedicine platforms.

Expected Impact:
Reduce misinformation in online medical queries.
Assist users in making informed healthcare decisions.

In this project we have used FAISS Vector database, Gradio for front end please import all the necessary libraries mentioned in the .pynb file and create a index file for FAISS.
Serve as a first-line AI assistant before consulting a doctor.
